   2 2024- 5- 1 SqlServer::execSql: why a first empty array in the result ?

   8 2024- 5- 2 implements and honors text-based telemetry

  14 2024- 5- 2 jsonRead should be only available through IJSONable (not in TTP)

  15 2024- 1-29 Toops::getOptions doesn't work as we do not know how to pass arguments to GetOptions()
     2024- 5- 2 these are called 'named options' and are got in the function through a hash though I don't know at the moment how to dintinguish between a hash and a hash ref

  25 2024- 5- 3 ttp->var() and others should be able to return a composite data (not only a scalar)
                and ttp.pl vars and others should be able to display them
	 2024- 5- 5 they actually do return composite data - just is not displayed by the verb
	            see daemon.pl dbms.pl services.pl ttp.pl

  26 2024- 5- 3 upgrade Canal33 backups from every.5h to every.2h (like the Tom's)

  27 2024- 5- 3 archivesBackups should be set when purging dailyBackups so that we keep for example 5 days in daily Backups and move the 6th to the archives

  31 2024- 5- 5 ws22prod1 inlingua33_archive is restored at 6h, but not inlingua31_archive nor inlingua59_archive
     2024- 5- 6 confirmed - this may be because there was only one execution report json file, so should be fixed with #30
     2024- 5- 9 still there: to be fixed

  39 2024- 5- 9 daemons do not publish their status to mqtt

  40 2024- 5- 9 telemetry: should have environment and emitter(command+verb) - see the push gateway @ 10.122.1.15:9091

  41 2024- 5- 9 daemons mqtt: publish all status informations

  42 2024- 5- 9

     2024- 5- 1 done

   3 2024- 5- 1 DBMS::hashFromTabular() and displayTabular() should be moved to TTP
     2024- 5- 1 displayTabular() is done
     2024- 5- 2 hashFromTabular() is done

     2024- 5- 2 done

   6 2024- 5- 1 IRunnable::filter() when called with direct command execution, only get the first line
                as in $running->filter( `$command` );
				while having my $res = `$command`; $running->filter( $res ) is fine
	 2024- 5- 2 is move to TTP:;:filter() -> to be retested
	 2024- 5- 3 happened that the arguments format depends of the call mode -> fixed

   7 2024- 5- 1 Daemon.pm let the daemon advertize its status to http-based and text-based telemetry
                provides labels through json configuration
	 2024- 5- 2 labels can be added via the Daemon API - closing

   9 2024- 5- 2 [backup-monitor-daemon.pl tom59-backup-monitor-daemon] (WAR) TTP::Metric::_http_publish() Code: 400 MSG: text format parsing error in line 1: invalid metric name in comment
                line is "# HELP ttp_tom17-backup-monitor-daemon The last epoch time the daemon has been seen alive"
	 2024- 5- 2 done (fix regexes)

  10 2024- 5- 2 backup-monitor-daemon.pl should advertize the remoteExecReportsDir but not as a msgVerbose as this later is too frequent
     2024- 5- 2 done (see #13)

  11 2024- 5- 2 check that httpMessaging and textMessaging can be disabled in daemon configuration (zero is it valid ?)
     2024- 5- 2 OK - needs interval be set to -1

  12 2024- 5- 2 daemon telemetry run since in sec, memory consumed
     2024- 5- 2 done for running since and for memory indicators

  13 2024- 5- 2 the daemon should be able to add its own mqtt topics
     2024- 5- 2 done

  16 2024- 5- 2 on ws12dev1, startup doesn't send alerts
     2024- 5- 5 same even after scheduled tasks path update
	            "services.pl list -workload startup -commands -hidden" returns (wrong) "C:\Temp\Site\Commands\startup.cmd"
				while "ttp.pl vars -key site,commandsDir" returns (right) "C:\INLINGUA\Site\Commands"
	 2024- 5- 5 fixed

  17 2024- 5- 3 ns332346 tasks didn't execute this morning 
	 2024- 5- 3 fixed with #24

				One line is normal as long as there is not yet any execution report to create the directory
				Why this second line ?
	 2024- 5- 5 seems that this doesn't reproduce - wait for two days...
     2024- 5- 6 stdout is clean as of 2024-05-06 09:43
     2024- 5- 7 stdout is clean as of 2024-05-06 09:41 -> closing

	 2024- 5- 3 fixed with #24

  21 2024- 5- 3 C:\INLINGUA\TheToolsProject\smtp\send.do.pl: Global symbol "$ttp" requires explicit package name (did you forget to declare "my $ttp"?) at C:\INLINGUA\TheToolsProject\libexec\perl/TTP/SMTP.pm line 48.
	 2024- 5- 3 fixed

	 2024- 5- 3 fixed with #6

  28 2024- 5- 3 services.pl list -commands: tasks of any workload hide tasks of other workloads
     2024- 5- 3 fixed by requiring the exact wanted workload

  29 2024- 5- 5 ws22prod1 has no daemon for Tom17 -> why didn't it have started this morning
     2024- 5- 5 the scheduled tasks form yesterday was still running - thus not trigerred this morning

  30 2024- 5- 5 ns3232346 while Tom59 has four databases, the execution reports show only one -> should have one execution report per database
     2024- 5- 6 confirmed: all the databases are saved, but only three execution reports: tom17+tom21+tom59: the four execution reports are sent to the same file
	            happens that TTP::random() is evaluated at bootstrap time, so once for the three files
     2024- 5- 6 fixed by a) removing the TTP::random() evaluation from site.json b) replacing it with a temp file templating in ttp.pl writejson

  32 2024- 5- 5 services.pl list -> log the displayed results
     2024- 5- 5 done

  33 2024- 5- 5 happens that $self = undef in new() classes methods do not work -> have another way to report errors
     2024- 5- 5 that works that returned value must be tested!
     2024- 5- 5 done

  34 2024- 5- 6 (war) telemetry are not requested on tom17, tom21, tom59.live.morning
     2024- 5- 6 fixed

  35 2024- 5- 6 (VER) checkDatabaseExists() returning true should also have the database name
     2024- 5- 6 done

  36 2024- 5- 6 jsonWrite() returns $VAR1 = bless( [

               ], 'Path::Tiny' ); -> two filenames ?
	 2024- 5- 6 this is just the standard return value of Path::Tiny->path() -> closed

  37 2024- 5- 7 ns3232346 no execution reports
     2024- 5- 7 fixed

  38 2024- 5- 7 backup daemons do not run
     2024- 5- 7 actually, they are running, but do not answer
	 2024- 5- 9 they answer but this is very long
	 2024- 5- 9 fixed by the freeing of rl9pilot1 work space
