# Synopsis:
#
#   We are using ssh to execRemote commands on remote hosts.
#   Unfortunately (or as a matter of fact), ssh does not initialize a
#   login shell when executing a remote command.
#   As we rely on the user's environment, we have to explicitely
#   initialize it.
#
#   This script is sourced at ssh time with the user credentials with
#   the '~/.ttp_remote' path.
#
#   It is up to the integrator to adapt this script to the user shell,
#   and install the result in each target home directory with the
#   expected name.
#
# (I): 1. (opt.) target execution node
#
# (O): -
